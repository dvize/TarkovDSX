# TarkovDSX
Use DSX Adaptive Triggers with Tarkov

This was developed using the steam version of DSX which is 5.99 i think?  There is an older free version that kind of works from the github here:
https://github.com/Paliverse/DualSenseX

You can grab the latest release from DEC 2021.
The free version doesn't have working lights or the vibrating triggers - i guess the format has changed so i'm not going to bother making it fully work with the free version.  I ask you to support the developers of this product if you can
